# Bedside Clock (Arduino)

## Description
A simple bedside digital clock using Arduino. It shows the current time using a DS3231 RTC module and a TM1637 LED 7 Segment display.

## Parts Used
- Arduino Uno R3
- DS3231 RTC module
- TM1637 LED 7 Segment Display 
- Active Buzzer
- 5V DC Power Cable
- CR2032 Lithium Battery 
- Breadboard and jumper wires (for prototyping)
- Will buy soldering parts for final design 

## Features
- Displays real-time clock in HH:MM
- Adjustable alarm buzzer 

## Wiring Diagram
To be added.

## Future Improvements
- Larger Display
    - Possibly matrix display, allowing date and
      other messages to be displayed as well as time
- Adjustable/dimmable lights

## Status
Prototype with working 12-hour clock and adjustable alarm. Buzzer only vibrates and it not loud enough, will get a louder buzzer and then begin soldering for final product. Also have to design a 3D printed body to hold everything.
