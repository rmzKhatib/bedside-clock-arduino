# Build Steps

## Step 1: Planning
- Decided to build a simple bedside alarm clock using an Arduino Uno.
- Decided to use the TM1637 4-digit 7 segment display for time display.
- Real time clock handled by the DS3231 RTC module.
- Alarm output using an active buzzer.
- Power supply:
    - 5V DC adapter and CR2032 battery for RTC backup

## Step 2: Parts Purchased 
- Arduino Uno R3
- DS3231 RTC module
- 5V DC power cable
- CR2032 lithium battery
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- TM1637 4 digit 7 segment display
- Already had the active buzzer

## Step 3: Research and Write Up a Wiring Plan
- Watch tutorials and other videos of wiring while waiting for parts to arrive
- Create a wiring plan from what I have learned

## Step 4: Wiring + Breadboarding (Upcoming)
- Will wire RTC, buzzer, and display on breadboard for prototyping
- Will upload test code using Arduino IDE

## Step 5: Final Build (Upcoming)
- Will design and 3D print enclosure
- Will solder components onto a perma board for permanent setup
